# Set Game
[Game Link](https://floatyboat.github.io/set-game/Set-Game/set.html)

Originally created by Marsha Jean Falco of Set Enterprises, Inc., Set is a card game with a board of non-duplicate cards. There are two levels of difficulty for this game. In Standard Difficulty there are 4 different attributes (style, color, shape, and count) - each attribute can have one of three values. For example, shape can have 3 values: "diamond", "oval", or "squiggle". In Easy Difficulty, all cards share a "solid" style attribute, so only the other 3 attributes can be different.

A Set is a selection of 3 cards such that for each of attributes, all three cards have the same value or none of the cards have the same value. Your goal is to find as many Sets as you can on the board!

Selecting an incorrect set will cost 15 seconds (+15 to clock in untimed, -15 to clock in timed)! Sometimes there won't be sets left on the board - you can reshuffle the board with a new collection of random cards.

Have fun!
